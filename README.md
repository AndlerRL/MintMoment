# MintMoments: MintMoments

## Mint Every Moment. Seamless Stream and Share Your Experiences

MintMoments is a revolutionary platform that allows users to stream and share their experiences at events in real-time. Whether you're at a concert, a conference, or a sports game, our app makes it easy to broadcast your perspective to the world. Connect to the web2 and web3 world by minting NFTs (or event rewards) from your event experiences.

## Introduction

In today's connected world, sharing experiences has become an integral part of how we communicate and engage with others. MintMoments was born from the idea that every moment at an event is unique and worth sharing. Our platform provides a seamless way for users to stream live content, while also allowing them to view streams from other attendees at the same event.

Think of it as a more focused, event-specific version of popular social media platforms. It's TikTok-esque in its simplicity and short-form content, but tailored specifically for live events.

## Functionality

MintMoments offers a range of features designed to enhance the event experience:

1. **Live Streaming**: Users can start a live video stream with just a tap, sharing their perspective of the event in real-time. Every end of stream will be scoring based on the number of viewers and interactions and be rewarded with NFTs.

2. **Event-Specific Rooms**: Each event has its own digital "room" event where all streams related to that event are collected and displayed. Every event has its own unique room, making it easy for users to find and share content (and authenticate, i.e. using tickets to get into an event).

3. **View Other Streams**: Users can watch both live and recent streams from other attendees at the same event, getting a multi-faceted view of what's happening. Every viewer can interact with the streamer by sending emojis and comments. The more interactions between streamers, the more the chance to be rewarded with NFTs.

4. **AI Narration**: An optional AI feature can provide real-time narration of what's happening in the stream, making content more accessible and adding an extra layer of engagement. Give your own event touch by narrating sports games, concerts, conferences or simple funny moments!

5. **Short-Form Content**: Streams are kept short (up to 60 seconds) to maintain engagement and allow for quick, easy consumption.

6. **Social Media Integration**: Users can easily share their streams to other social media platforms directly from the app. This optional feature allows users to reach a wider audience and increase engagement.

7. **Event Recap**: After an event ends, all streams are compiled to create a comprehensive recap of the event from multiple perspectives.

8. **NFT Integration**: Users can mint their event activity by streaming or interacting within the platform. A seamless way to mint NFTs from your event experiences. We gamify the event experience by rewarding users with NFTs based on their interactions and stream quality.

## Product Design Problem and Solution

### Problem

In the current digital landscape, sharing live experiences at events is often fragmented and lacks a cohesive platform. Users typically rely on general social media platforms that are not optimized for event-specific content, leading to a diluted and less engaging experience. Additionally, these platforms do not provide a unified view of an event from multiple perspectives, making it difficult for users to fully immerse themselves in the event atmosphere.

### Solution

MintMoments addresses these issues by providing a dedicated platform for live event streaming. The app's event-specific rooms collect all related streams in one place, offering users a comprehensive and immersive experience. The short-form content format ensures high engagement, while features like AI narration and social media integration enhance accessibility and sharing capabilities. By focusing on live events, the app creates a unique and engaging way for users to share and experience events in real-time.
